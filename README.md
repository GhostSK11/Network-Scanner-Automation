# Introduction 
Minimal requirements:
-  Identify a task within their chosen elective that could benefit from automation
-  Create a high-level workflow for this automation (purpose not technology)
-  Utilize Git as a source repository for the automation code
- This could be python, bash, PowerShell, ansible or anything else that demonstrates what the student has learned
- Utilize CI/CD pipes to support the chosen automation

I tried to choose an assignment that would correspond to my specialization. 

I choose the task from “CIS Control 1: Inventory and Control of Hardware Assets”, step 1.1 – Utilize an Active Discovery Tool. 

This step involves extracting information about connected devices to the organization's private network via CI / CD (pipelines) tools.

The entire system is maintained in the Git Azure repository and can be managed through the Microsoft Azure Dev Ops environment. 

For security reasons, the Python script (code) is backed up on GitHub.


# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Installation process
2.	Software dependencies
3.	Latest releases
4.	API references

# Build and Test
TODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests. 

# Contribute
TODO: Explain how other users and developers can contribute to make your code better.
